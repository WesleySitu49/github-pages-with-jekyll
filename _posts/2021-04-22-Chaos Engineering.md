# Humanistic Chaos

* Humans in the system
  * As Dr Sidney Dekker said 
  > view people as a solution to harness rather than a problem to control, 
  > and consider safety more as a presence of positive capacities.
  * Look at it from a refreshed lens.
  * We want a highly reliable, robust and resilient team of engineers.

* Spotting Weak Signals - What is the pulse of the team?
  * Look for signals if we may be exhausting the capacity while simultaneously looking for ways to grow capacity boundary

* Game days
  * Schedule and planning - identify game runners.
  * Game Execution
  * Incident response. Watch the response and look for gaps in process/monitoring/alerting
  * Incident review
