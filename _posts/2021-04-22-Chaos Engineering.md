#Humanistic Chaos
* View people as solution to harness rather than a problem to control
  * Look at it from a refreshed lens.
  * We want a highly reliable, robust and resilient team of engineers.

* Spotting Weak Signals - What is the pulse of the team?
  * Look for signals if we may be exhausting the capacity while simultaneously looking for ways to grow capacity boundary
* Game days
  * Schedule and planning - identify game runners.
  * Game Execution
  * Incident response. Watch the response and look for gaps in process/monitoring/alerting
  * Incident review
